# Predictive-Modeling-Project
Description: 
This project involves using various models to predict wine quality using alcohol content in wines

## Project Overview
#### Motivation
>The goal of this project is to predict red wine quality based on its alcohol content using various machine learning models. This initiative addresses a critical business need within most industries, where understanding and predicting product quality is vital for producers, distributors, and retailers.
### Features
>Different Machine Learning techniques used were: Simple linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Regression Trees, Support Vector regression, and Multiple Perceptron(MLP) modeling.
## Data
